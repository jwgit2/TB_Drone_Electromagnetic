The objective of this bachelor thesis is the design and construction of an embedded system to be mounted on a drone to make geo-localized, time-stamped measurements of the atmospheric electric field.

Lightning protection and knowledge of this phenomenon are based mainly on measurements of current and atmospheric fields at ground level. In this project, an embedded electric field measurement system will be developed to be mounted on a drone for the collection and storage of data for later analysis. 

This work is related to a research project funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation on the study of the initiation and characteristics of upward lightning discharges. The embedded system will be developed and tested in Yverdon-les-Bains and Lausanne. Tests at the SÃ¤ntis experimental facility in the canton of Appenzell are also foreseen depending on the availability and development status of the embedded system and the drone.
